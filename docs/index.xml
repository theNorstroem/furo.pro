      <description>Installation #  You can install furo on your local machine. For working with specs only, this is enough. We recommend furoBEC if you have to generate more then &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; the specs. furoBEC is a docker image which has nearly all dependencies already installed to generate all the additional things you may need to.
Installation with brew #  brew tap theNorstroem/tap brew install furo  Installation with go #  GO111MODULE=on go get github.</description>

      <description>Quickstart Guide #  The easiest way to try out furo is by using furo init with the furo-BEC container. The container brings all the additional tools you need to generate the grpc stubs.
In this guide we will setup a furo spec project with the furo init command. The furo cli will then create the needed files to have a working project with a sample µType and µService definition.</description>

Synopsis #  Runs a configured flow of furo commands.
A flow is a list of custom commands or furo run commands which are executed.
To configure a custom command, add them to the commands section of the .furo config file.
Example Config:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  commands:publish_npm:&amp;#34;./scripts/test.sh&amp;#34;flows:default:- muSpec2Spec- publish_npmpublish:- publish_npm  Tipp: If you need the types and services in your command, just call furo again.</description>

      <description>furo muSpec2Spec #  Updates or creates the specs with the definitions from the µSpecs.
Renaming and restructuring your spec folder is ok, furo will always update the correct file. Also a reordering of the fields in your spec, to get nicer protos of for other reasons, is also ok. Furo works with a internal AST and is not interested in order or file names.
Attention: if you have set the config option muSpec.</description>

      <description>Configuration #  Each spec project must have a configuration file. The furo cli tool will look up for .furo in the current working directory or can be called with the --config option.
You can generate a config file with a inital project structure by calling furo init.
As you can see, the config file is a regular yaml file and is easy to edit in any text editor or IDE.</description>

      <description>Working with Dependencies #  You can install another spec in to your project, to use their types.
Note: A installable dependency must be reachable by your git command.  Install a spec project #  To install a dependency add them to the dependencies section of the config. It is a list with git repositories followed by a version tag or branch name.
By running furo install the dependency will be added to the configured directory in your project.</description>

      <description>furo checkImports #  This command will check and correct all the needed imports in the specs. These imports are needed for creating proper proto files.
If a import can not be resolved, you will get a error message which tells you the file and the field which is causing the problem.
How does the import resolving work? #  Furo will look up for type definitions as close as possible to your type (most local to least local).</description>

This comes very handy in custom generators which are ok with the yaml file structure.
Feel free to add custom sections in the config to use them in your own scripts.

The generated proto messages will be generated to the configured path.
 As you may have noticed the specs have a attribute targetfile. Type specs with the same target file value will be generated in to the same file.
 Attention: You can not target Services and Messages to the same file, because for furo, the generating of types/messages and the generation of services are two different tasks.</description>

      <description>furo genServiceProtos #  Generate the service protos from the service specs.

 As you may have noticed the specs have a attribute targetfile (target in µServices, sorry). Service specs with the same targetfile or target value will be generated in to the same proto file.

Sanitizing includes at the moment:
 Adding of query params which are part of the url and needs to be listed as qp&amp;rsquo;s for the request body.  A method definition like:
1 2  - md: &amp;#39;Get:GET /sample/{smp} google.protobuf.Empty , sample.SampleEntity#Returns a single Sample.&amp;#39;  will become to

      <description>furo spec2muSpec #  Updates or creates the µSpecs with the definitions from the specs.
 if you have set the config option muSpec.forceSync: true in your furo config, the command will always enable the -d option.
 Because the specs have a higher information density then the µSpecs this step will loose information.
This command is useful if you want to switch your source of truth from spec to µSpec.</description>

      <guid>http://furo.pro/posts/movingToEclipse/</guid>
      <description>We started to move the many parts of the furo project from theNorstroem to eclipse last month.
This forced us to restructure the individual parts of furo. The restructuring definitely brings us some advantages for the project itself.
For the consumers, the sharp separation of the involved components, a cleaner naming and improved documentation will give them a better view of the big picture.
We kept the changes that you have to made as low as possible.</description>
